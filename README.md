<h1> Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning by VSD </h1>
<h2> Introduction </h2>

This is my repo for the 2 week VSD course on PnR using OpenLane and SkyWater PDK. The course covers floorplanning and standard cell design, designing and characterizing a library cell, pre-layout timing analysis and clock tree synthesis, all using opensource tools for the SkyWater 130nm process. This repo will contain the notes I take, and the screenshots and the files generated while doing the tasks assigned, both for my own and for anyone else's reference.
